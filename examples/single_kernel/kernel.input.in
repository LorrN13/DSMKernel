eventName = Explosion00

eventLocation = 0.d0 0.d0 214.d0

! eventLocation is defined with three floats: latitude, longitude, depth
!  (for any planet)
! there is no interpolation in source depths

MomentTensor = 1e35 1e35 1e35 0.d0 0.d0 0.d0

! MomentTensor should be in Mrr, Mtt, Mpp, Mrt, Mrp, Mtp order
! for video kernel, please set a big value like 1.e35

stationName = testStation


stationLocation = 0.d0 40.d0

! stationLocation is defined with two floats: latitude and longitude
! no support for stations in depth


phaseName=normalP


component = Z

! we have Z/R/T options but N/E options will be ready to implement


paramWRT = all

	  paramWRT seismic parameter (alpha, beta, or all for this version)
	  	   if you choose "test" the program will only give you the synthetic
		     (fort.13 in your directory too)
          if you choose "alphaV", "betaV" or "allV", this will calculate waveform derivative
	     and in that case, you have to put real value (timeincrementV in second)
	  if you choose "vRSGT" or "vTSGT", it will write wave propagation video

timeincrementV = 20.d0

	  if you choose any "video" options for paramWRT, we need this to resample the field
	     coarsely if you wish

ibwfilt = 1

	  if ibwfilt = 1 butterworth filter on; if 0 off


filterName = 100s10s

	  not mendatory even if ibwfilt = 1, software will prepare a name for it

lowHighPoles = 1d-2 1.d-1 2

	   lowest freq. [Hz], highest freq. [Hz], number of poles

twin = 410.d0 420.d0 440.d0 450.d0
     
     time window t1, t2, t3, t4 
     (if t1=t2 and t3=t4, fwin(:) will be rectangular)
     (otherwise we use sine functions for tapering between t1-t2 and t3-t4)

itraslat = 0
	 ! itranslat (1 if you convert geodetic latitude to geocentric latitude)



iBananaCentred = 0
	 ! if you want to look at a simple banana doughnut between the epicentre and
	 ! the station, check 1
	 ! if you need to know partials (banana as well) for specific locations in
	 ! the real coordinates, check 0
	 !
	 ! if this parameter is not defined, we take iBananaCentred = 0


! Below are minor parameters for kernel computation: if you don't want to touch,
! you do not have to write them (erase all below) and we will take a default values


ipdistance = 10.d0
	   ! ipdistance is a SINC interpolation window
	   ! (ipdistance deg) (it works well with 10-20 degrees)


c_red_reci = 0.d0
	   ! reducing slowness for interpolation (c_red_reci s/deg)
	   (if 0.d0 we do not perform slowness reduction)


ifastFFT  = 0
	  ! fast FFT (if 1 on; if 0 off)
	  ! you can re-define imin and imax for FFT of Green functions
	  ! thence you can avoid reading frequencies for which you don't have to account.


fminfmax = 0 256

	 ! 
	 ! if ifastFFT = 1; lowest i(freq), highest i(freq) (note that freq = i(freq)/tlen)
	 ! if ifastFFT = 0; just don't write anything (anyways the code will ignore this)


# Ca. gridding and extent in R(longitudinal) direction (dph, ph1)
5.d-1 10.d0
# Cb. gridding and extent in T(transverse) direction (dth, thw)
5.d-1 10.d0
# Cd. gridding in radius (rmin, rmax, deltar : should correspond to grids in catalogue)
# if you put 0.d0 0.d0 0.d0 then the program will take the grids in catalogue
#0.d0 0.d0 0.d0

# Db. sampling Hz 
2.0d0
# Ea. ignoring criteria (calculrapide: we ignore the values below; if 0.d0 we don't use the algo)
#         (in Fuji et al. 2012b, we chose 5.d-3)
0.d0
#
# Eb. number of kernel types for the ignoring scheme (if Ea. = 0.d0, just comment out all)
#1
#    
# Ec. kernel type for ignoring scheme (if 0 we calculate for the envelop) note them vertically
#0

# F. PSV/SH (PSV only = 2; SH only = 1; PSV+SH =3)
